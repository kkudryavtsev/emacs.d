This is my emacs directory and setup config.  I've had it a long time
and just recently went through and cleaned it up.  These days I'm
pretty much only using emacs for ruby/html/css/js editing.  As such,
there's some stuff in here (particularly ruby-config.el wrt
compilation mode) that breaks for other stuff.

I have ~/.emacs sym linked to ~/emacs.d/init.el and ~/.emacs.d
symlinked to ~/emacs.d.  Maybe I don't need these symlinks, but it
seems like I do.  Basically, my init.el has some global variables set,
sets my load path to include all the subdirs and stuff, then starts
loading the *-config.el files.  It's easy to turn off features this
way by simply commenting them out of init.el to not load them.  Also,
it keeps all my config wrt some feature set in one place to go look
at.
